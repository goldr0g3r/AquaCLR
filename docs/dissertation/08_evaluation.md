# Chapter 8 — Evaluation Methodology

> **Learning objectives**
> By the end of this chapter you will be able to:
>
> 1. Define every evaluation metric used (PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, UCIQE, latency, VRAM).
> 2. Decide which metric to apply on which dataset and why.
> 3. Run the full evaluation suite end-to-end against a checkpoint.
> 4. Interpret an ablation table and identify which component contributes most.
>
> **TL;DR.** We pre-register four metric families: **reference-based**
> (PSNR, SSIM) on MSRB-test and LSUI-val, **no-reference** (UIQM,
> UCIQE) on UIEB-Challenge, **operational** (latency p50/p95/FPS,
> peak VRAM) on RTX 3050 in TRT FP16, and **physics-quality**
> (forward-consistency residual, t-smoothness) on all sets. The
> ablation plan removes one component at a time
> (`L_phys`, `L_ssim`, `L_tv`, `L_t`, EMA, BF16, `torch.compile`,
> mix ratio) and reports the delta on each metric.

## 8.1 Metric design — what we measure and why

| Family          | Metric                 | Where                        | Range                    | Tells us                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- |
| Reference-based | **PSNR**               | MSRB-test, LSUI-val          | dB (≈18-35 typical)      | How close `Ĵ` is to `J_gt` pixel-wise         |
| Reference-based | **SSIM**               | MSRB-test, LSUI-val          | [-1, 1]                  | Local structural agreement                    |
| No-reference    | **UIQM**               | UIEB-Challenge (+ MSRB-test) | unbounded, higher better | Generic "underwater goodness"                 |
| No-reference    | **UCIQE**              | UIEB-Challenge (+ MSRB-test) | unbounded, higher better | Colour balance / saturation                   |
| Operational     | **latency p50/p95**    | RTX 3050 + TRT FP16          | ms / frame               | Hits the < 15 ms budget?                      |
| Operational     | **FPS**                | same                         | frames / s               | Throughput                                    |
| Operational     | **VRAM peak**          | same                         | MB                       | Hits the < 1 GB run-time budget?              |
| Physics         | **forward residual**   | MSRB-val                     | mean abs in [0, 1]       | `                                             |     | I − F(J_gt, t̂, B̂) |     | ₁`  |
| Physics         | **t-smoothness**       | MSRB-val                     | mean abs                 | `mean(                                        | ∇t̂  | )`, anisotropic   |
| SLAM downstream | **KP count Δ**         | MSRB-test                    | %                        | More features after enhancement?              |
| SLAM downstream | **Repeatability**      | MSRB-test                    | [0, 1]                   | Scene points re-detected after enhancement    |
| SLAM downstream | **Match inlier ratio** | MSRB-test                    | [0, 1]                   | RANSAC-verified geometric consistency (I → Ĵ) |
| SLAM downstream | **Match score**        | MSRB-test                    | Hamming or L2            | Descriptor confidence (lower = sharper)       |

We deliberately **pre-register** these metrics in this dissertation
_before_ running the experiments in Chapter 10. This protects
against post-hoc cherry-picking.

## 8.2 PSNR — peak signal-to-noise ratio

### 8.2.1 Definition

For images in `[0, 1]`:

$$
\mathrm{PSNR}(\hat{J}, J) \;=\; 10 \,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{MSE}(\hat{J}, J)}\right)
$$

where MSE is the mean squared error over all pixels and channels.
For 8-bit images in `[0, 255]` the numerator becomes `255²`.

### 8.2.2 Implementation

We use TorchMetrics' `PeakSignalNoiseRatio(data_range=1.0)`. It is
distributed-aware (works correctly with multi-GPU sums), accumulates
across batches, and emits a single number per validation epoch.

### 8.2.3 What PSNR is good and bad at

| Good                                            | Bad                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheap to compute                                | Insensitive to local structure (a uniformly-shifted image scores the same as a destroyed one of the same MSE) |
| Comparable across papers (universal definition) | Saturates: 30+ dB looks identical to the eye despite mathematical difference                                  |
| Convex in pixel space                           | Penalises bright outliers quadratically (heavy-tail issue)                                                    |

## 8.3 SSIM — structural similarity

### 8.3.1 Definition

$$
\mathrm{SSIM}(x, y) = \frac{(2\mu_x \mu_y + C_1)(2\sigma_{xy} + C_2)}{(\mu_x^2 + \mu_y^2 + C_1)(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + C_2)}
$$

with statistics computed in an 11×11 Gaussian window
(`σ = 1.5`), `C_1 = (0.01 \cdot L)²`, `C_2 = (0.03 \cdot L)²`,
`L = 1.0` for `[0, 1]` data.

### 8.3.2 Why SSIM matters more than PSNR for SLAM

SLAM cares about edges and corners. SSIM measures whether local
edge structure is preserved. A method that scores 25 dB PSNR but
**0.92 SSIM** preserves SLAM-relevant features; one that scores
26 dB PSNR but **0.85 SSIM** has flattened texture in a way that
hurts feature matching.

### 8.3.3 Implementation

TorchMetrics' `StructuralSimilarityIndexMeasure(data_range=1.0)`.
Internal kernel matches our loss-side SSIM (`window=11`,
`σ=1.5`, `K_1=0.01`, `K_2=0.03`).

## 8.4 UIQM and UCIQE — no-reference metrics for UIEB-Challenge

For UIEB-Challenge there is **no clean reference image**, so PSNR
and SSIM are unavailable. The community has converged on two
no-reference scores.

### 8.4.1 UIQM (Underwater Image Quality Measure) [Panetta 2016]

A weighted combination of three sub-measures:

$$
\mathrm{UIQM} = c_1 \cdot \mathrm{UICM} + c_2 \cdot \mathrm{UISM} + c_3 \cdot \mathrm{UIConM}
$$

where:

- **UICM** is colourfulness based on `(R−G)`, `(R+G−2B)/2` chromaticity statistics,
- **UISM** is sharpness via Sobel-magnitude entropy,
- **UIConM** is contrast in the AME (Asymmetric Modulation Estimation) sense,

with default weights `c = (0.0282, 0.2953, 3.5753)` from the original paper.

### 8.4.2 UCIQE (Underwater Colour Image Quality Evaluation) [Yang 2015]

In CIE-Lab space:

$$
\mathrm{UCIQE} = w_1 \cdot \sigma_c + w_2 \cdot \mathrm{con}_l + w_3 \cdot \mu_s
$$

where `σ_c` is chroma standard deviation, `con_l` is luminance
contrast (max-min), and `μ_s` is saturation mean. Default weights
`w = (0.4680, 0.2745, 0.2576)`.

### 8.4.3 Caveats

Both metrics are **proxies**. They correlate with human preference
but not perfectly. We report them for comparability with prior
underwater literature, not as ground truth. We deliberately report
**both** so a reader can see consistency.

### 8.4.4 Implementation choice

We use [`pyiqa`](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch) (PyTorch
implementations of both), as an _optional_ dependency. Install with:

```bash
pip install pyiqa
```

The metrics are integrated in [`scripts/evaluate.py`](../../scripts/evaluate.py)
behind the `--no-ref` flag, which is silently skipped if `pyiqa` is not
installed. The relevant code pattern (BCHW float `[0, 1]` tensors):

```python
import pyiqa
_uiqm_metric = pyiqa.create_metric("uiqm", device=device)
_uciqe_metric = pyiqa.create_metric("uciqe", device=device)

# j_pred: (B, C, H, W) float32 in [0, 1] — no uint8 conversion needed
scores_uiqm = _uiqm_metric(j_pred.clamp(0.0, 1.0))   # → Tensor (B,)
scores_uciqe = _uciqe_metric(j_pred.clamp(0.0, 1.0))  # → Tensor (B,)
```

We report `mean ± std` over all images in the test set. Unlike PSNR/SSIM,
no ground-truth image is required — UIQM/UCIQE can therefore be applied
on held-out unpaired sets such as UIEB-Challenge.

## 8.5 Operational metrics — latency, throughput, VRAM

### 8.5.1 Latency definitions

We report three latency statistics over `n_iter = 200` warmed-up runs:

| Statistic | Definition                                                  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **p50**   | 50th percentile (median) inference time                     |
| **p95**   | 95th percentile — captures tail latency                     |
| **mean**  | Arithmetic mean — for reproducibility with prior literature |

Implementation: [`src/aquaclr/inference/benchmark.py::benchmark_pytorch`](../../src/aquaclr/inference/benchmark.py).
For TRT we replicate the same harness against a `TensorRTRunner`
instance.

### 8.5.2 Throughput

$$
\mathrm{FPS} = \frac{1000}{\mathrm{mean\_ms}}
$$

We report on `batch=1` (the deployment-relevant case for ROS2
streaming).

### 8.5.3 VRAM peak

`torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()` after `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()`.
Captures the maximum activation + parameter memory the GPU saw
during inference. Should sit well under the 1 GB run-time budget.

### 8.5.4 Reporting protocol

```
| Path             | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | mean (ms) | FPS | Peak VRAM (MB) |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --- | -------------- |
| PyTorch FP32     |          |          |           |     |                |
| PyTorch FP16     |          |          |           |     |                |
| TensorRT FP16    |          |          |           |     |                |
| TensorRT INT8    |          |          |           |     | (M2)           |
```

Always at 720p (1280×720) batch=1, on the canonical RTX 3050.

## 8.6 Physics-quality metrics

To audit the physics-informedness of the trained network — beyond
just "the recovered image looks right":

### 8.6.1 Forward-physics residual

For each `(I, J_gt, t̂, B̂)` in MSRB-val:

$$
r = \bigl\| I - F(J_{\text{gt}}, \hat{t}, \hat{B}) \bigr\|_1
$$

Lower `r` = predicted `(t̂, B̂)` are physically meaningful given
the GT `J`. We report the mean of `r` over the val set.

### 8.6.2 Transmission smoothness

$$
\mathrm{TV}(\hat{t}) = \mathbb{E}\bigl[ |\partial_x \hat{t}| + |\partial_y \hat{t}| \bigr]
$$

Captures whether the transmission map is piecewise-smooth (low TV)
as the model expects, or salt-and-pepper noise (high TV).

### 8.6.3 Backscatter sanity

For the predicted `B̂` vector: report **mean and standard
deviation** across MSRB-val. If `B̂` is wildly variable across
similar scenes, the head has not learned a useful prior.

## 8.7 Ablation plan

Each ablation **removes or swaps one component** at a time and
reports the delta on every metric. The full plan:

| ID     | Ablation                  | What changes                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A0** | Baseline (full system)    | —                                                                         |
| A1     | `λ_phys = 0`              | Drop forward-consistency loss                                             |
| A2     | `λ_ssim = 0`              | Drop SSIM loss                                                            |
| A3     | `λ_tv = 0`                | Drop TV regulariser on `t`                                                |
| A4     | `λ_t = 0`                 | Drop direct `t` supervision (LSUI batches still train recon+phys+ssim+tv) |
| A5     | EMA off                   | `EMAWeightCallback` disabled                                              |
| A6     | `precision = "16-mixed"`  | FP16 instead of BF16                                                      |
| A7     | `compile.enabled = false` | No `torch.compile`                                                        |
| A8     | MSRB-only                 | `data=msrb` (no LSUI)                                                     |
| A9     | LSUI-only                 | `data=lsui`                                                               |
| A10    | Mix 50/50                 | `mix_ratio = (0.5, 0.5)`                                                  |
| A11    | Backbone-from-scratch     | `pretrained: false`                                                       |
| A12    | No backbone freeze        | `freeze_backbone_epochs: 0`                                               |
| A13    | Per-channel `t` (oracle)  | swap t-head to 3-channel; needs net change — sketch only                  |

Each experiment is run with the **same seed** (1337), the same data
splits, and the same hardware so deltas are attributable to the
single change.

### 8.7.1 Reporting template

```
| ID  | Variant                     | val PSNR | val SSIM | UIQM | UCIQE | Latency p50 | VRAM | Forward residual |
| --- | --------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---- | ----- | ----------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| A0  | Full                        |          |          |      |       |             |      |                  |
| A1  | -L_phys                     |          |          |      |       |             |      |                  |
| ... |                             |          |          |      |       |             |      |                  |
```

Chapter 10 fills this table with measured numbers from the
trained models.

### 8.7.2 What we expect (pre-registration)

| Ablation            | Expected sign of `Δ val/PSNR`          | Justification                                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1 (-L_phys)        | **−** (small)                          | Recon dominates; physics term mostly affects `(t, B)` consistency |
| A2 (-L_ssim)        | **−** (clear)                          | SSIM is what guards SLAM-relevant edges                           |
| A3 (-L_tv)          | + on val PSNR, **−** on UIEB           | TV hurts strict pixel fit but improves generalisation             |
| A4 (-L_t)           | + on MSRB, **−** on UIEB               | LSUI's `t_gt` improves generalisation, slightly hurts MSRB-val    |
| A5 (EMA off)        | **−** (~0.3 dB)                        | Standard EMA effect                                               |
| A6 (FP16)           | ≈ 0 if no overflow, big − if overflow  | BF16 is safer                                                     |
| A7 (no compile)     | ≈ 0 on quality, **−** on training time | Compile is purely a speed lever                                   |
| A8 (MSRB only)      | + on MSRB, **−** on UIEB               | MSRB-only overfits its synth distribution                         |
| A9 (LSUI only)      | **−** (clear)                          | LSUI lacks discrete particulates                                  |
| A10 (50/50)         | minor                                  | Should be close to A0                                             |
| A11 (no pretrain)   | **−** (large)                          | ImageNet features matter                                          |
| A12 (no freeze)     | **−** (small)                          | Backbone damaged by random head gradients early                   |
| A13 (per-channel t) | ≈ 0 PSNR, **−** size                   | Doubles head params without visible benefit                       |

Chapter 10 reports actual deltas; matches between expected and
measured signs validate the methodology.

## 8.8 Cross-domain generalisation tests

Beyond the held-out UIEB-Challenge eval, we additionally check:

| Test                                           | Hypothesis                           | Evidence form                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Train MSRB-Task-1, eval MSRB-Task-2            | Smaller particles transfer to larger | PSNR delta                    |
| Train MSRB+LSUI, eval RUIE-UIQS                | Generalises to a third real dataset  | Qualitative + UIQM            |
| Train at 256², eval at 720p (no retrain)       | Architecture is resolution-flexible  | PSNR + UIQM                   |
| Inject Gaussian noise on UIEB before inference | Robust to sensor noise               | PSNR / UIQM curves vs noise σ |

These are stretch tests; we report them descriptively rather than
declare pass/fail thresholds.

## 8.9 Latency budget verification

The 15 ms target is composed of:

| Stage                      | Budget (ms) | Implementation                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |

The benchmark harness measures only the inference component (the
11 ms slice). End-to-end latency including I/O is reported in
Chapter 10 from a recorded ROS2 bag.

## 8.10 Statistical reporting practices

For each metric reported in Chapter 10:

1. **Mean ± standard deviation** computed across the relevant
   validation/test set.
2. **Bootstrap 95 % confidence interval** with 1000 resamples for
   the headline metrics (PSNR, SSIM on MSRB-test). Computed via:

   ```python
   from scipy.stats import bootstrap
   ci = bootstrap((per_image_psnr,), np.mean, n_resamples=1000,
                  confidence_level=0.95).confidence_interval
   ```

3. **Three random seeds** for the headline ablation rows (A0, A1,
   A4, A8). Other rows are single-seed.

This avoids reporting a fluke result without doubling the compute
budget.

## 8.11 Reporting practice — readability over numerical density

Following the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/),
all results tables in Chapter 10 use:

- 2 decimal places for PSNR (e.g. 25.43), 4 for SSIM (e.g. 0.9182).
- Percentage points expressed as `±N.N pp` (not `±N.N %`).
- Bold the best value in each column.
- Single-row stats: cell value `± std`. Double-row stats:
  `value (95 % CI low – high)`.

## 8.12 The exact commands an examiner runs

To re-produce every number in Chapter 10:

```bash
# 1. Train the baseline.
python scripts/train.py train.run_name=A0_baseline

# 2. Run each ablation.
for tag in A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 A11 A12; do
  python scripts/train.py train.run_name=$tag <ablation flags from §8.7>
done

# 3. Evaluate on MSRB-test, LSUI-val, UIEB-Challenge.
for ckpt in outputs/A*/ckpts/*.ckpt; do
  # Reference-based (always)
  python scripts/evaluate.py --ckpt $ckpt --data-root data/msrb --split test --task 1
  # No-reference (requires: pip install pyiqa)
  python scripts/evaluate.py --ckpt $ckpt --data-root data/msrb --split test --task 1 --no-ref
  # SLAM feature stability
  python scripts/evaluate_slam_features.py --ckpt $ckpt --data-root data/msrb --split test --task 1
done

# 4. Latency benchmark (PyTorch + TRT).
python scripts/export_onnx.py --ckpt outputs/A0_baseline/ckpts/best.ckpt \
    --build-trt --benchmark --height 720 --width 1280
```

The expected wall-clock for the full ablation matrix on a single
RTX 3050 is ~14 days. Chapter 10 records which subset was actually
run and which were extrapolated.

## 8.13 Downstream SLAM feature stability benchmark

> **Motivation.** PSNR and SSIM measure pixel-level fidelity. They do
> not directly answer the operational question: _does LEGION-DeSnow
> help SLAM?_ Marine snow fires keypoint detectors spuriously
> (particle streaks look like corners). The SLAM Feature Stability
> Benchmark answers this directly by comparing feature extractor
> outputs before and after enhancement.

### 8.13.1 Script

[`scripts/evaluate_slam_features.py`](../../scripts/evaluate_slam_features.py)

For each `(I, Ĵ, J_gt)` triple in MSRB-test, the script:

1. Converts each tensor to grayscale uint8 (standard OpenCV input).
2. Runs the chosen feature extractor on all three images.
3. Computes the four metrics below.
4. Aggregates `mean ± std` over the dataset and prints a summary
   table.

Dependencies: `opencv-python-headless` (always in core deps).
SIFT requires `opencv-contrib-python`; the script auto-falls-back
to ORB if SIFT is unavailable.

### 8.13.2 Metrics defined

**Keypoint count Δ (%)** — the percentage change in detected
keypoints from raw `I` to enhanced `Ĵ`. Positive means the model
reveals scene features hidden under marine-snow:

$$
\Delta_{kp} = \frac{N_{kp}(\hat{J}) - N_{kp}(I)}{N_{kp}(I)} \times 100
$$

**Repeatability (I→Ĵ)** — fraction of keypoints detected on `I`
that are re-detected on `Ĵ` within `dist_thresh` pixels. Measures
positional consistency under the enhancement transform:

$$
\mathrm{Rep} = \frac{|\{k \in \mathrm{KP}(I) : \exists k' \in \mathrm{KP}(\hat{J}),\; \|k - k'\| \le \delta\}|}{|\mathrm{KP}(I)|}
$$

where `δ = dist_thresh` (default 3 px).

**Match inlier ratio (I→Ĵ)** — after mutual-nearest-neighbour
descriptor matching with Lowe's ratio test (default `r = 0.75`),
RANSAC-verified geometric inliers divided by post-ratio matches:

$$
\mathrm{MIR} = \frac{|\mathrm{RANSAC\ inliers}|}{|\mathrm{ratio\text{-}test\ matches}|}
$$

Since `I` and `Ĵ` depict the same scene, a well-behaved de-noiser
should yield MIR close to 1 — i.e. SLAM would correctly associate
the enhanced and raw frames.

**Match score** — mean best-match descriptor distance among
ratio-test-passing matches. Hamming distance for ORB, L2 for SIFT.
Lower = more discriminative descriptors.

### 8.13.3 Automotive SiL parallel

This benchmark is the subsea analogue of a camera de-rain SiL
quality gate in an ADAS stack: run ORB on raw rainy frames, on
de-rained frames, and on GT-clean frames; compare feature yield and
repeatability. The same harness is used to sign off sensor
preprocessing blocks in ADAS SiL pipelines before downstream
integration.

### 8.13.4 Running the benchmark

```bash
# Default: ORB, 2000 features, dist_thresh=3 px, Lowe ratio=0.75
uv run python scripts/evaluate_slam_features.py \
    --ckpt outputs/<run>/ckpts/best.ckpt \
    --data-root data/msrb --split test --task 1

# SIFT with larger feature budget:
uv run python scripts/evaluate_slam_features.py \
    --ckpt outputs/<run>/ckpts/best.ckpt \
    --data-root data/msrb \
    --detector sift --n-features 1500 --dist-thresh 5
```

Example output:

## Key takeaways

- We pre-register **five** metric families: **reference-based**
  (PSNR, SSIM), **no-reference** (UIQM, UCIQE),
  **operational** (latency, VRAM), **physics-quality**
  (forward residual, t-smoothness), and **SLAM-downstream**
  (keypoint count Δ, repeatability, match inlier ratio).
- The right metric depends on the dataset: PSNR/SSIM on
  MSRB-test, UIQM/UCIQE on UIEB-Challenge, SLAM metrics on MSRB-test.
- No-reference metrics (`--no-ref`) require `pip install pyiqa`;
  they are silently skipped otherwise.
- Latency / VRAM are reported on RTX 3050 at 720p in TRT FP16,
  including p50, p95, mean, FPS, and peak VRAM.
- The ablation plan **changes one component at a time** (A1–A13)
  with expected directional outcomes pre-registered.
- All headline rows include 95 % bootstrap CIs and three-seed
  variance.
